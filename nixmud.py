"""A simple Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) game. Players can talk to each

other, examine their surroundings and move between rooms.

Some ideas for things to try adding:

    * More rooms to explore

    * An 'emote' command e.g. 'emote laughs out loud' -> 'Mark laughs

        out loud'

    * A 'whisper' command for talking to individual players

    * A 'shout' command for yelling to players in all rooms

    * Items to look at in rooms e.g. 'look fireplace' -> 'You see a

        roaring, glowing fire'

    * Items to pick up e.g. 'take rock' -> 'You pick up the rock'

    * Monsters to fight

    * Loot to collect

    * Saving players accounts between sessions

    * A password login

    * A shop from which to buy items
